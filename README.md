# Python_Photo_Searcher_and_Georeferencer
Photo Searcher and Georeferencer

By Grant Haynes

This is a simple Python 2.7 script meant for use with ArcMap, it was used successfully in ArcMap 10.7. It's purpose is to aid in rebuilding
old geotagged datasets where the photos are in a directory and the photo name is in the GIS dataset. This tool will go through the 
directory find the photo by matching the name and writethe photo filepath as well as the photo datatime into the GIS dataset where it then 
can be turned into a proper geotagged GIS dataset.

Note:
This is meant to be implemented as a script tool
